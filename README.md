### Hello world! 👋🏿

I'm Olu.

👩🏿‍💻 I'm currently a Javascript developer at [Oddbird](https://oddbird.net) and a member of the [W3C Developer Council](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/reintroducing-the-w3c-developer-council-b9028f7739bf). 

👍🏿 My pronouns are they/them.

🔭 I’m currently looking for writing and speaking opportunities; [I have written for A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/article/building-the-woke-web/).

🌱 I’m currently learning (more and more about) web accessibility, advanced React and Javascript, algorithms and computer science fundamentals, social justice, ukulele, sewing and making cosmetics. Feel free to chat to me about any of the above!

🤔 I’m looking for help with a project to catalog the history of web accessibility and technological disability activism.

📫 You can reach me on Twitter or email.
