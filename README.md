### Hello world! 👋🏿

I'm Olu. 

👍🏿 My pronouns are they/them.

🔭 I’m currently looking for a job! Hire me, innit.

🌱 I’m currently learning (more and more about) web accessibility, advanced React and Javascript, Rust, algorithms and computer science fundamentals, social justice, ukulele, sewing and making cosmetics. Feel free to chat to me about any of the above!

🤔 I’m looking for help with a project to catalog the history of web accessibility and technological disability activism; design help for my personal website; design help for my meetups; help with learning how to create online events that are immersive and fun and collaborators.

📫 You can reach me on Twitter or email.
